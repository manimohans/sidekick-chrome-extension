## Short Description (132 char limit)

The only local AI sidebar with per-site personas and multi-tab queries. Works with Ollama, LM Studio & more. 100% private.

## Description

Most AI extensions send your data to the cloud and treat every website the same. Sidekick doesn't.

**What makes Sidekick different**

1. Per-Site Personas — Sidekick automatically switches personality based on the website you're on. GitHub gets a code reviewer. Reddit gets a discussion analyst. YouTube gets a summarizer. No other extension does this. Create your own personas for any site.

2. Multi-Tab Queries — Select multiple open tabs and ask anything across all of them. Compare products, summarize research tabs, find common themes. One prompt, multiple pages, instant synthesis. No copy-pasting between tabs.

3. Truly Private — Your data never leaves your machine. No cloud APIs, no accounts, no API keys, no telemetry. Sidekick talks directly to your local LLM server. Period.

**Also included**
- Sidebar chat that reads the page you're on automatically
- YouTube transcript extraction built-in
- Select any text and ask about it
- Slash commands: /summarize, /explain, /professional, /actions, /twitter
- Real-time streaming with conversation history and live tok/s speed counter
- Collapsible thinking token display for reasoning models (DeepSeek, QwQ, etc.)
- Image paste support for vision models
- 6 built-in personas, fully customizable

Works with Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM, AnythingLLM, and any OpenAI-compatible server.
